# DJANGO

Django is a back-end server side web framework.

Django is free, open source and written in Python.

Django makes it easier to build web pages using Python.

Django emphasizes reusability of components, also referred to as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and comes with ready-to-use features like login system, database connection and CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete).
